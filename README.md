Encryption2
Overview
Encryption2 is a Java program designed to read text from a specified file, apply a Caesar cipher encryption with a user-defined shift value, and output the encrypted text. This program provides a simple and effective way to encrypt text files using a basic cryptographic technique.

Features
File Input: Allows users to specify the input file path containing the text to be encrypted.
User Interaction: Utilizes the console for user input, prompting for the file path and shift value.
Caesar Cipher Encryption: Implements a Caesar cipher algorithm to shift characters in the input text based on the provided shift value.
File Handling: Handles file reading, encryption, and exceptions, providing informative messages in case of file not found.

How to Use

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/encryption2.git

Compile:
javac encryption2.java
Run:
java encryption2

Follow prompts:
Enter the input file path.
Enter the shift value.

Output:

The program will display the encrypted text based on the specified shift value.
Example
Enter the input file path: input.txt
Enter the shift value: 3
Encrypted Text: Wklv lv d whvw phvvdjh.

Notes
Ensure that the input file exists and the file path is accurate.
The shift value can be positive or negative, affecting the direction of the encryption.
